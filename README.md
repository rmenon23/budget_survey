# Budget Survey Analysis

The following R files were used to analyze the 2017 budget survey data. The results were reported to TPS and the Board to communicate the community's perception of the budget reduction items. 

The following R scripts do the following:
* acceptability.R - Reports the level of acceptability for individual budget items that were proposed in the budget survey. This script also produces a graph for this particular analysis.

* budget_selection.R - Creates a visualization for the $1000 simulation item

* community_roles.R - Creates a doughnut graph with who responded to the survey.

* ranking.R - Creates a ranked list of all budget items

* transform_budget_data.R - This script takes in the survey results and reformats them for use in the budget survey analysis.
